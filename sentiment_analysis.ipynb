      "Review : My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working. \n",

Sadly the person it was purchased for was unable to hold onto it long enough to use it (elderly lady). I still have it though, and it's a great little backup to my primary tablet. \n",

      "Review : The echo has a small problem in that it is a blue tooth receiver only. You can blue tooth your devises to it, tablet , phone ,or other devices. It would be better if you could connect it to a good quality stereo receiver that enable blue tooth. The dot can be connect to blue tooth speakers or blue tooth capable audio receivers. The Dot does have a small speaker in it so if it is not connected you can still use it. The problem with the dot is if you use the included 3.5 mm audio jack it disable the internal speaker. This means you have to have the audio component on to hear the Dot. However the blue tooth connection on the Dot works great. I own a Marantz AV receiver with blue tooth. I tell Alexa to connect and it automatically turns on the receiver, set it to the correct input and is ready to play music or any other audio I want to listen to through the Dot. When I tell Alexa to disconnect it turns of the receiver and switches back to the internal speaker. If you are buying an echo device for a high quality music server using Amazon music then you want an echo Dot.If you want to listen to average sounding speaker that you can place just about any where in your house the Echo is a great product. \n",
